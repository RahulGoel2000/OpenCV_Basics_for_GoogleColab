# Load Images and Video using OPEN CV in Google Colab

##Welcome to the basics of OPENCV with Google Colab

## Hi, I am Ankit Verma, graduate student at CU ICAR. This repository enables you load images and video in Google Colab

## Today we will work on the most fundamental start point of OpenCV - Importing files. While it is a fairly easy topic, to be able to do so in Google Colab needs some different functions

#This notebook covers the following parts

- Importing and displaying an image
- Importing and displaying a video
- Importing live feed of a webcam
